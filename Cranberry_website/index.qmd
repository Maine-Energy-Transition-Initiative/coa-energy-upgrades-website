Our team can perform a free home energy assessment, giving you an objective look at your home’s construction and energy systems. Then, we will make several recommendations for improving your home’s comfort, efficiency, and safety and share information about available rebates and tax credits to help pay for upgrades. If you choose to implement any of the recommendations, we can help coordinate contractors and arrange for lower rates by bundling upgrades with your neighbors. [Learn more about our process](process.qmd)
