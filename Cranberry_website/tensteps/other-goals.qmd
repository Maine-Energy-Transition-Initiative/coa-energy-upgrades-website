**High-efficiency wood stove**

Consumes less wood while retaining all the benefits of a wood stove

New high-efficiency wood stoves are up to twice as efficient as older models, cutting wood consumption by up to half while providing as much heat to the home. Wood stoves are a great source of backup heat during power outages.

**Whole-home surge protection**

Improved home safety and resilience, provides insurance against electrical surges

As we electrify our energy consumption, and especially with the complex electronics in these systems, it is essential to install whole-home surge protection. These devices can cost \$100-400, and need to be installed by an electrician. A single surge event can cause more damage than the upfront cost of the surge protector.

**Ventilation**

Improves air quality and promotes even temperature distribution

As we seal our buildings and reduce air leakage (drafts), mechanical ventilation becomes more important. In many homes, exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathrooms are adequate. When homes are very tight, ventilation that both exhausts stale air and brings in fresh air is needed. Energy-recovery and heat-recovery ventilators exchange heat between the incoming and outgoing air, to temper the fresh air coming in and reduce heat loss.
