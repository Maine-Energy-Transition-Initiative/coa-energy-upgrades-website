 Energy savings of 10-30%

-   Sealing the basement or crawlspace blocks rodents and heat loss.

-   Vapor barrier prevents ground moisture from getting into the house - reducing mold.

-   We recommend 3” of spray foam (R-21) from floor up over the rim joist to air seal and retain heat. This is an incredible improvement for fieldstone foundations. 

-   Make sure the contractor uses HFO/5th generation/low-Global Warming Potential spray foam. Older HFC blowing agents have 500x the carbon emissions!
