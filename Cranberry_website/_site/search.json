LED light bulbs  Energy savings of 5-10%\nHigher quality, longer-lasting light that costs less on electricity bills\n\nLEDs use 85% less energy than incandescent bulbs, and reduce monthly energy costs by $20-30 for an average home.\n\n3. Window Dressers  Energy savings of 5-10%\nReduces draftiness, making you feel warmer and lowering heating costs\n\nInsulated window inserts improve indoor comfort and energy efficiency for less than 1/10th the cost of replacing windows. www.windowdressers.org \n\n4. Heat pump water heater (HPWH)  Energy savings of 10-20%\nMore energy efficient water heating, saving costs on long-term energy bills and reducing fossil fuel usage\n\nUse 70% less energy than a standard electric water heater.\nSignificant rebates available through Efficiency Maine that increase their affordability.\nSide benefit of helping dehumidify the space they’re in, like a damp basement.\n\n5. Electric appliances  Energy savings of up to 10%\nImproved health and safety while improving energy costs and reducing fossil fuel usage\n\nMeasure your refrigerator’s energy use and upgrade to an EnergyStar model as needed. \nReplace gas cooking equipment with induction or electric for health and safety.\n\n6. Energy audit  Health and Safety\nComprehensive guide to energy issues within the home\n\nHave a comprehensive audit to assess air leakage and insulation needs for your home.\nMeasures energy use, identifies opportunities for improvements, and identifies moisture problems or health and safety needs like ventilation and mold remediation. \n\n7a. Basement/crawl space sealing  Energy savings of 10-30%\nPrevents heat from leaving the house and moisture and pests from entering\n\nSealing the basement or crawlspace blocks rodents and heat loss.\nVapor barrier prevents ground moisture from getting into the house - reducing mold.\nWe recommend 3” of spray foam (R-21) from floor up over the rim joist to air seal and retain heat. This is an incredible improvement for fieldstone foundations. \nMake sure the contractor uses HFO/5th generation/low-Global Warming Potential spray foam. Older HFC blowing agents have 500x the carbon emissions!\n\n7b. Attic and wall air sealing and insulation  Energy savings of 10-25%\nPrevents heat from escaping the house, improving the efficacy of insulation\n\nBecause warm air rises, a significant portion of heat loss is through the attic. \nAir sealing first ensures that insulation works properly.\nWe recommend 18-24” of cellulose insulation to achieve R60-R80 in attics.\n\n8. Air source heat pumps  Energy savings of 10-40%\nMore energy efficient air heating and cooling year-round, saving costs on long-term energy bills and reducing fossil fuel usage\n\nProvide winter heating and summer cooling and dehumidification for your home.\nWork in temperatures as low as -15F, and can be the sole source of heat if your home is well insulated.\n\n9. Electric Vehicle\nRemoves gas bills and reduces fossil fuel dependence\n\nA 2020 study by Consumer Reports found that the lifetime ownership costs were significantly lower for EVs. Most EVs saved between $6,000 - $10,000 over their lifetimes.\n\n10. Solar  Energy production up to 100%\nGenerates self-sufficient energy, lowering energy bills and reducing dependence on fossil fuels and commercial energy grids\n\nInstall rooftop solar to supply all your electricity needs.\n30% federal tax credit and financing options are available.\nBattery backup is needed for solar to work during a power outage\n\n\n\nOther Improvements\nHigh-efficiency wood stove\nConsumes less wood while retaining all the benefits of a wood stove\nNew high-efficiency wood stoves are up to twice as efficient as older models, cutting wood consumption by up to half while providing as much heat to the home.

Our process begins with an in-depth assessment of a home to identify the most cost-effective upgrades to improve comfort and energy efficiency. For homeowners who want to make upgrades, the team can coordinate with contractors to reduce hassle and costs.\nIn addition to the assessment team, we have a data science team that can quantitatively analyze the benefits provided by the installed upgrades. For a limited number of homeowners, the data science team can also measure air quality contaminants using wifi-enabled monitors and conduct before and after monitoring of energy upgrades."

LED light bulbs Energy savings of 5-10%\n\nHigher quality, longer-lasting light that costs less on electricity bills\n\nLEDs use 85% less energy than incandescent bulbs, and reduce monthly energy costs by $20-30 for an average home.\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      3. Window Dressers Energy savings of 5-10%\n\nReduces draftiness, making you feel warmer and lowering heating costs\n\nInsulated window inserts improve indoor comfort and energy efficiency for less than 1/10th the cost of replacing windows. www.windowdressers.org \n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      4. Heat pump water heater (HPWH) Energy savings of 10-20%\n\nMore energy efficient water heating, saving costs on long-term energy bills and reducing fossil fuel usage\n\nUse 70% less energy than a standard electric water heater.\n\nSignificant rebates available through Efficiency Maine that increase their affordability.\n\nSide benefit of helping dehumidify the space they’re in, like a damp basement.\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      5. Electric appliances Energy savings of up to 10%\n\nImproved health and safety while improving energy costs and reducing fossil fuel usage\n\nMeasure your refrigerator’s energy use and upgrade to an EnergyStar model as needed. \n\nReplace gas cooking equipment with induction or electric for health and safety.\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      6. Energy audit Health and Safety\n\nComprehensive guide to energy issues within the home\n\nHave a comprehensive audit to assess air leakage and insulation needs for your home.\n\nMeasures energy use, identifies opportunities for improvements, and identifies moisture problems or health and safety needs like ventilation and mold remediation. \n  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      7a. Basement/crawl space sealing Energy savings of 10-30%\n\nPrevents heat from leaving the house and moisture and pests from entering\n\nSealing the basement or crawlspace blocks rodents and heat loss.\n\nVapor barrier prevents ground moisture from getting into the house - reducing mold.(Deleted some info)\n\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      7b. Attic and wall air sealing and insulation Energy savings of 10-25%\n\nPrevents heat from escaping the house, improving the efficacy of insulation\n\nBecause warm air rises, a significant portion of heat loss is through the attic. \n\nAir sealing first ensures that insulation works properly.\n\nWe recommend 18-24” of cellulose insulation to achieve R60-R80 in attics.\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      8. Air source heat pumps Energy savings of 10-40%\n\nMore energy efficient air heating and cooling year-round, saving costs on long-term energy bills and reducing fossil fuel usage\n\nProvide winter heating and summer cooling and dehumidification for your home.\n\nWork in temperatures as low as -15F, and can be the sole source of heat if your home is well insulated.\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      9. Electric Vehicle\n\nRemoves gas bills and reduces fossil fuel dependence\n\nA 2020 study by Consumer Reports found that the lifetime ownership costs were significantly lower for EVs. Most EVs saved between $6,000 - $10,000 over their lifetimes.\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class =\"flex-box\"&gt;\n      10. Solar Energy production up to 100%\n\nGenerates self-sufficient energy, lowering energy bills and reducing dependence on fossil fuels and commercial energy grids\n\nInstall rooftop solar to supply all your electricity needs.\n\n30% federal tax credit and financing options are available.\n\nBattery backup is needed for solar to work during a power outage\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;"

If you answered yes to any of these questions, we’d like to help!\n\n\n\nOur team can perform a free home energy assessment, giving you an objective look at your home’s construction and energy systems. Then, we will make several recommendations for improving your home’s comfort, efficiency, and safety and share information about available rebates and tax credits to help pay for upgrades. If you choose to implement any of the recommendations, we can help coordinate contractors and arrange for lower rates by bundling upgrades with your neighbors. Learn more about our process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe look forward to helping you make your house more comfortable and cost efficient!\n\n\n\n\n\nInsulating an attic using a cellulose blower"
